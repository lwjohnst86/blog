I am currently a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the
Department of Nutritional Sciences.  My primary research is in
diabetes epidemiology.  Working with data and statistics is, to me,
incredibly fun!  I enjoy learning about and using advanced statistical
and programming techniques to extract novel findings from datasets.
Part of my passion also lies in educating other graduate students and
scientists, especially in the area of data-heavy analysis, on the
guidelines for proper and reproducible analysis, as well as on
techniques to making coding easier and cleaner.
