I am currently a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the
Department of Nutritional Sciences.  My primary research is in
diabetes epidemiology.  Working with data and statistics is, to me,
incredibly fun!  I enjoy learning about and using advanced statistical
and programming techniques to extract novel findings from datasets.
Part of my passion also lies in educating other graduate students and
scientists, especially in the area of data-heavy analysis, on the
guidelines for proper and reproducible analysis, as well as on
techniques to making coding easier and cleaner.

## Purpose of this site ##

I write blogs for three purposes:

1. Create tutorials and learning resources for doing statistical
   analysis a better way, found in the "Statistics" section.
2. Communicate about interesting theoretical, abstract, and
   philosophical aspects of science and statistics, found in the
   "Science" section.
3. Write about (partly) non-science, more personal aspects of life in
   general such as on religion or politics, found in the "Life"
   section.

The "Statistics" section will mostly contains blogs on using SAS, R,
and in the future Python.  This section is more of the practical side
of doing science, such as running the analysis, interpreting the
results, managing the dataset (both during collection and after), and
also with collecting it.  There will also be blogs about techniques on
doing reproducible research, such as using git, knitr, pandoc's
markdown, and LaTeX.  This section is in particular targeted to
graduate students and researchers looking to make their analyses
reproducible and their coding easier.

The "Science" section will contain blogs on what science is and is
not, highlighting pseudoscience and non-science, and discussing
important topics in science such as reproducibility, improvements to
the current scientific process, and so on.

The "Life" section will be on random things that I feel like writing
about, such as politics, religion, and society.
