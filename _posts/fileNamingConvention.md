# File Naming Convention #

Some rules were taken from the website from the
[University of Edinburgh](http://www.recordsmanagement.ed.ac.uk/InfoStaff/RMstaff/RMprojects/PP/FileNameRules/Rules.htm)

## Rules: ##

1. Keep the names short, but meaningful. Remove unnecessary words such
   as the, and, a, etc.

2. Don't include spaces and avoid underscores. For a string of words,
   capitalize the first letter of each word, except for the first word
   (e.g. "fileNameDescription")

3. Use hyphens to separate important parts of the name or when there
   is an abbreviation followed by another word (e.g.
   "diabetesRisk-AnalysisOutput" which separates the two concepts, the
   project descriptor ["diabetesRisk"] and the contents of the file
   ["AnalysisOutput"], or "report-AnalysisFoodIntake-2014.pdf" and not
   "reportAnalysisFoodIntake2014.pdf").

4. Avoid redundancy in file names and file paths
   (e.g. folderName/fileName-folderName.txt, instead use
   folderName/fileName.txt, or
   "diabetesSatFats/analysis-DiabetesSatFats.sas", use
   "diabetesSatFats/analysis.sas")

5. If a number is included in the filename, such as for the version
   number, use two digits not one (e.g. V01, not V1).

6. When including a date, include it at the very end of the filename
   and in the international standard format YYYY-MM-DD.
