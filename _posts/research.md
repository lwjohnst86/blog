## Research question ##

    Develop and focus
    Following lit search and conceptual diagram creation, refine/expand research question based on new info. Repeat lit search based on revision


## Lit search ##

    See litSearch.mm file
    Near comprehensive/systematic

## Create conceptual diagrams based on lit search and on the issues ##

    Use VUE

## Develop DAG of the issue. ##

    Use TETRAD


## Write up a draft of the intro and think about potential journals based on question ##

## Write up methods ##

    Construct a-priori list of analyses to run, plots to generate (exploratory and for manuscript)
    Develop methods justification, p-value cut-off, etc.
    Refine analyses following exploration

## Construct skeletal results section (tables - pgfplotstable; figures - knitr) ##

    Refine in light of exploration

## From dataset ##

    Extract relevant variables from master ds
    run univariate and bivariate analyses + exploratory plots
        If new insights come up here, may need to revise question/do further lit search.

## Run complex analyses (GLM, GEE, PCA, etc.) ##

    Build models
    Check diagnostics
    fit statistics
    visualization

## Write up results (knitr + pgfplotstable) ##

## Start up discussion ##

    Use results + lit rev to direct discussion
    May need additional lit search (very lightly)

## Based on findings, refine journal to submit to. ##
