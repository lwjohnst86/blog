SEt up a research institute as an entity, so that the "bus factor" is
increased (compared to traditional models of science where the lead PI
has everything).

Establish rules and guidelines for conducting shared research:

* No primary PI (or at least several)
* Code reviews
* Methods critiques
* Culture of improvement, critiques, getting better, planning,
  organizing, learning
* Publish as a group (or group as last author)/corresponding author
* All data is open and shared (at least for the group)
* Consult with programmers, database experts
* Policies on how workflow is
    - Always update them, fit with effectiveness + efficiency
* Focus on documentation + training

Goal/mission/reason:

* The goal is for an entity to transend the limitation of individual's
  livespans/deaths and to limit the
* Also to allow greater integration between RCT, epi, basic science,
  data science, methodology, etc.
* Primary focus is on impactful research and secondarily on advocacy
  for better funding, governmental policies on research, etc.

Issues:

* How to deal with attribution to the researchers as individuals
* How to deal with copyright, etc. of patentable items
    - Stick with the MIT/Waterloo model, whoever invented the item
      gets the patent we just ask (and repeatedly remind) them to help
      us in the future when they make lots of money
